/**
 * Process-wide gate for project-scoped Kimchi and Claude Code resources
 * (`.kimchi/`, `.claude/`).
 *
 * Detection lives upstream of this module: the trust-scan extension in
 * `patches/@earendil-works__pi-coding-agent@0.84.1.patch` makes pi's
 * `hasTrustRequiringProjectResources` treat those folders as trust-requiring,
 * so pi prompts (or fail-closes headlessly) before loading anything. This
 * gate is the enforcement side: every kimchi-side reader of project-local
 * resources — `loadConfig()`, permissions, bash hooks, skill roots, agents
 * settings/personas/memory, tags, ferment objective files — must consult
 * `isProjectScopeAllowed()` and skip project/local scope while it is closed.
 *
 * Fails closed: a cwd with no recorded decision is untrusted, so a cloned
 * repo's project-local config (endpoint, API key, skill paths), permissions,
 * hooks, skills, agents, memory, tags, and plans stay inert until trust is
 * established.
 *
 * Decisions are keyed by cwd and resolved ancestor-first (nearest recorded
 * cwd-or-ancestor wins), mirroring pi's `ProjectTrustStore` lookup: one
 * decision covers a whole working tree, and ancestor-walking readers
 * (`.kimchi/skills`, `.kimchi/tags.json`) are gated by the session cwd's
 * decision. Cwd-keying also keeps concurrent ACP sessions in one process
 * isolated from each other's trust decisions.
 *
 * The gate is set from two places, both after trust has been settled:
 * - `settingsTrustSyncExtension` on every session_start (pi resolves project
 *   trust before extensions load), and
 * - the ACP server's `createSessionSettings` after its headless resolution.
