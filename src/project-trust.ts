 *    (there is nothing project-scoped to gate).
 * 2. A decision persisted in <agentDir>/trust.json (from a previous interactive
 *    run's trust prompt) is honored.
 * 3. Otherwise the `defaultProjectTrust` setting decides: "always" trusts,
 *    "never" refuses, and "ask" — with no UI to ask — falls back to untrusted,
 *    exactly like pi's own no-UI path.
 *
 * `defaultProjectTrust` must come from a global-scope read (a manager created
 * with projectTrusted: false): a project must not be able to grant itself
 * trust through its own .pi/settings.json.
